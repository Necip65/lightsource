# Lightsource

This small routine calculates a projection of a set of coloured light points onto a given number of arbitrarily positioned and rotated surfaces.

The planes can be moved. Please click on them and use the gizzmo. After the mouse up event the projection is calculated again.

With this you can create light effects, as you know them from colourful church windows.
